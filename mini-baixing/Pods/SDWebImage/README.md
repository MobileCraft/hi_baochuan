Web Image
=========

> **Psst! [SDWebImage 3.0 beta](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/tree/3.0-beta) is out!**

This library provides a category for UIImageVIew with support for remote images coming from the web.

It provides:

- An UIImageView category adding web image and cache management to the Cocoa Touch framework
- An asynchronous image downloader
- An asynchronous memory + disk image caching with automatic cache expiration handling
- A background image decompression
- A guarantee that the same URL won't be downloaded several times
- A guarantee that bogus URLs won't be retried again and again
- A guarantee that main thread will never be blocked
- Performances!

### Using UIImageView+WebCache category with UITableView

Just #import the UIImageView+WebCache.h header, and call the setImageWithURL:placeholderImage:
method from the tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath: UITableViewDataSource method. Everything will be
handled for you, from async downloads to caching management.

```objective-c
#import <SDWebImage/UIImageView+WebCache.h>

...

- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    static NSString *MyIdentifier = @"MyIdentifier";

    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:MyIdentifier];

    if (cell == nil)
    {
        cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault
                                       reuseIdentifier:MyIdentifier] autorelease];
    }

    // Here we use the new provided setImageWithURL: method to load the web image
    [cell.imageView setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.domain.com/path/to/image.jpg"]
                   placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"placeholder.png"]];

    cell.textLabel.text = @"My Text";
    return cell;
}
```

### Using blocks

If your project's deployement target is set to iOS 4+, you may want to use the success/failure blocks to be
notified when image have been retrieved from cache.
```objective-c
// Here we use the new provided setImageWithURL: method to load the web image
[cell.imageView setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.domain.com/path/to/image.jpg"]
               placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"placeholder.png"]
                        success:^(UIImage *image, BOOL cached) {... success code here ...}
                        failure:^(NSError *error) {... failure code here ...}];
];
```

Note: neither your success nor failure block will be call if your image request is canceled before completion.

### Using SDWebImageManager

The SDWebImageManager is the class behind the UIImageView+WebCache category. It ties the
asynchronous downloader with the image cache store. You can use this class directly to benefit
from web image downloading with caching in another context than a UIView (ie: with Cocoa).

Here is a simple example of how to use SDWebImageManager:

```objective-c
SDWebImageManager *manager = [SDWebImageManager sharedManager];
[manager downloadWithURL:imageURL
                delegate:self
                 options:0
                 success:^(UIImage *image, BOOL cached)
                 {
                     // do something with image
                 }
                 failure:nil];
```

### Using Asynchronous Image Downloader Independently

It is possible to use the async image downloader independently. You just have to create an instance
of SDWebImageDownloader using its convenience constructor downloaderWithURL:delegate:.
```objective-c
downloader = [SDWebImageDownloader downloaderWithURL:url delegate:self];
```

The download will start immediately and the imageDownloader:didFinishWithImage: method from the
SDWebImageDownloaderDelegate protocol will be called as soon as the download of image is completed.

### Using Asynchronous Image Caching Independently

It is also possible to use the NSOperation based image cache store independently. SDImageCache
maintains a memory cache and an optional disk cache. Disk cache write operations are performed
asynchronous so it doesn't add unnecessary latency to the UI.

The SDImageCache class provides a singleton instance for convenience but you can create your own
instance if you want to create separated cache namespace.

To lookup the cache, you use the imageForKey: method. If the method returns nil, it means the cache
doesn't currently own the image. You are thus responsible for generating and caching it. The cache
key is an application unique identifier for the image to cache. It is generally the absolute URL of
the image.

```objective-c
UIImage *myCachedImage = [[SDImageCache sharedImageCache] imageFromKey:myCacheKey];
```

By default SDImageCache will lookup the disk cache if an image can't be found in the memory cache.
You can prevent this from happening by calling the alternative method imageFromKey:fromDisk: with a
negative second argument.

To store an image into the cache, you use the storeImage:forKey: method:

```objective-c
[[SDImageCache sharedImageCache] storeImage:myImage forKey:myCacheKey];
```

By default, the image will be stored in memory cache as well as on disk cache (asynchronously). If
you want only the memory cache, use the alternative method storeImage:forKey:toDisk: with a negative
third argument.

### Using cache key filter

Sometime, you may not want to use the image URL as cache key because part of the URL is dynamic
(i.e.: for access control purpose). SDWebImageManager provides a way to set a cache key filter that
takes the NSURL as input, and output a cache key NSString.

The following example sets a filter in the application delegate that will remove any query-string from
the URL before to use it as a cache key:

```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [[SDWebImageManager sharedManager] setCacheKeyFilter:^(NSURL *url)
    {
        url = [[[NSURL alloc] initWithScheme:url.scheme host:url.host path:url.path] autorelease];
        return [url absoluteString];
    }];

    // Your app init code...
    return YES;
}
```


Common Problems
---------------

### Using dynamic image size with UITableViewCell

UITableView determins the size of the image by the first image set for a cell. If your remote images
don't have the same size as your placeholder image, you may experience strange anamorphic scaling issue.
The following article gives a way to workaround this issue:

[http://www.wrichards.com/blog/2011/11/sdwebimage-fixed-width-cell-images/](http://www.wrichards.com/blog/2011/11/sdwebimage-fixed-width-cell-images/)

Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
----------------------------------

You can use either style in your Cocoa project. SDWebImage Will figure out which you are using at compile
time and do the right thing.


Installation
------------

There are two ways to use this in your project: copy all the files into your project, or import the project as a static library.

### Add the SDWebImage project to your project

- Download and unzip the last version of the framework from the [download page](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/downloads)
- Right-click on the project navigator and select "Add Files to "Your Project":
- In the dialog, select SDWebImage.framework:
- Check the "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)" checkbox

### Add dependencies

- In you application project appâ€™s target settings, find the "Build Phases" section and open the "Link Binary With Libraries" block:
- Click the "+" button again and select the "ImageIO.framework", this is needed by the progressive download feature:

### Add Linker Flag

Open the "Build Settings" tab, in the "Linking" section, locate the "Other Linker Flags" setting and add the "-ObjC" flag:

![Other Linker Flags](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/123346/SDWebImage/10_other_linker_flags.jpg)

### Import headers in your source files

In the source files where you need to use the library, import the header file:

```objective-c
#import <SDWebImage/UIImageView+WebCache.h>
```

### Build Project

At this point your workspace should build without error. If you are having problem, post to the Issue and the
community can help you solve it.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

- LRU memory cache cleanup instead of reset on memory warning
